        <p>These readings made me realize that websites are actually like personal projects or even digital homes that can show who you are and connect you with others.

        Carpenter talks about websites as if they're crafted by hand, where every link and image is carefully chosen to bring people and ideas together. Schwulst compares a website to a house that keeps changing, which I think is an interesting way to see it because it means your website can grow and change with you. It's not just a static thing, but a reflection of your personality and how you evolve over time.
        
        Putting content on the internet is about sharing a part of yourself with the world. It's a way to express your creativity, share your knowledge, and connect with people. 
        
        As for websites becoming obsolete, I don't think the basic idea of sharing and connecting online will ever become obsolete. The way we use websites might change with new technologies like virtual reality, but the reason we do it will always be important.
        
        My own relationship with technology is double sided. On one hand, I see how beneficial it can be for bringing people together and letting people express themselves. But I also get what Le Guin is saying about technology being just a tool. It's all about how we use it. We shouldn't let it take over our lives or replace real-life experiences and connections.
        
        Overall, these readings have made me appreciate the internet more as a place for creativity and connection. They've showed that it's important to be thoughtful about how we use technology and to make sure it adds value to our lives and the lives of others.</p>
