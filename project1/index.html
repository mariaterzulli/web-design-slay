                <h2>Synopsis</h2>

                <h3>
                    The Woman In Me chronicles Spears's journey to stardom, her publicized challenges, and her endeavors to break free from a longstanding conservatorship that once controlled her life... 
                </h3>

                    In the beginning of the memoir, Spears writes that her paternal grandmother, Emma Jean Spears, was sent to an asylum by Spears's paternal grandfather. Their three-day-old baby had died and Emma Jean was overwhelmed by grief. While at the asylum, Emma Jean was put on lithium; later she shot herself over the child's grave. Spears added that "tragedy runs in my family".

                    Spears also writes that she was marketed as innocent, even though she had been a regular smoker since the age of 14 and lost her virginity around the same time. In 2002, her then-boyfriend Justin Timberlake dumped her by text on the set of a music video. When she became pregnant by Timberlake, she writes that he persuaded her to undergo an abortion. Spears writes that Timberlake continuously cheated on her: "Photographers caught Justin with one of the girls from All Saints in a car." After the break-up, her public image suffered, she started to burn out, and began abusing the prescription drug Adderall] She also admitted that she cheated on Timberlake with dancer Wade Robson.

                    She described her two-week sexual fling with actor Colin Farrell in the memoir. Spears wrote that the reason for her 55-hour marriage to Jason Alexander was, that she was "drunk and very bored." She wrote that her family got angry after finding out about her marriage. Spears wrote: "They made way too big a deal out of innocent fun. Everybody has a different perspective on it, but I didn't take it that seriously. I thought a goof-around Vegas wedding was something people might do as a joke. Then my family came and acted like I'd started World War III. I cried the whole rest of the time I was in Las Vegas."

                    Spears discusses her relationship with Kevin Federline and the struggles she faced after becoming a mother, including suffering from postpartum depression. The memoir also goes into further detail and provides new perspective about widely publicized events in Spears' life, including shaving her head and attacking a paparazzo with an umbrella. <br><br>

                <p>THANK YOU, BRITNEY !!! <br> <br> 
                    I believe that this book was the divinely orchestrated outcome of Britney's harrowing tale of abuse, betrayal, and valiancy. She does not owe the world anymore pieces of herself, however she wrote this book heroically as a gift to those who saved her. This book is beautiful-- perfect karma for her and everybody who has a hand in, or turned the other cheek to her suffering. Britney's voice will forever echo within our society as a martyr for those enslaved to the machine that is capitalism and plain greed. They stole from her, took everything that ever meant anything to her away from her, used, abused, and tried to break her spirit like horse beaten into submission. Chilling and triumphant. Britney is finally free! I think we all owe her an apology, as well as a great big THANK YOU for enduring this incredibly personal and painful exposition to society on our habitually overlooked decisions driven by greed and corrupt processes lacking moral sanctity for the autonomy of another's life and character. It is clear to me that Britney was chosen to do this because she was strong enough to live through it to tell the tale. <br> <br>This book of hers is not only powerfully moving, but without a doubt, MONUMENTAL FOR OUR TIME.

                    I was really excited to get hold of a copy of Britney Spears's book "Woman In Me" and to start reading it.  
                    I was quite disappointed not to learn anything new about her as a person, what she is like day to day, away from the spotlight, and I was hoping for lots of revealing and shocking shenanigans in this book, if I'm honest, but they just weren't there! After reading it, I would say that this is more of a therapeutic book for Britney to get things off her chest, and for her to feel empowered after everything she has endured. I get that Britney has been through an awful time with her family, regarding the conservatorship, and how badly they treated her for many years, but most of this book seems to focus on that, and feels repetitive. Where are all the stories of the fun things that Britney has done in her life, that she's proud of? Like her huge tours, making those fabulous videos, even just girly nights in and doing stuff with her two sons? <br> <br>
                    I would've loved to read anecdotes about everyday things that have happened to her, along with the more recent sadder part of her life, to balance out the book. <br><br>
                    Overall, I don't think I'd read this book again, as I just didn't find it very interesting.  Genuine review of this book, 3 stars out of 5 I give it. üìö

                <p>Aimless and redundant. No natural flow throughout the narrative... Syntax so bad it actually made me uncomfortable. I feel for her and am so glad she decided to do the book but holy moly.</p>
