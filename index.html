    <!--11/29 CLASS NOTES
         an image tag has no closing it is just <img> -->
    <!-- path to an image is in the same folder as the website hmtl file, there is a website folder-->
    <!-- <img src="images/portrait.jpg"> is image source, these are called relative links
         when they are going back to an image source or another page-->
    <!-- absolute link is for an image that is on another website
    alt attribute stands for alternative text, which is text that describes an image, alt tags are
    important for accessible websites
    **if you make the browser narrower the browser will make it automatically wrap
    **when you change folder/image names make sure you update the name in your code, it is better to usre lowercase letters and no special characters

    CSS stands for cascading stle sheets, it has its own formatting that can be put directly in html but it is recommended to put your css in its own document and then connect the two (embed css in html)
    html = elements , css = rules 
    there is a selector and a declaration in css p{color:yellow;} 
    each declaration has a property and a value. ^ property = color, value = yellow 
    
    color= color name (boring) rgb values, rgba values (with alpha), hex code
    fontstack p {font-family:Helvetica, Arial (if helvetica isn't available, sans-serif(then just pick a sans serif font);)
