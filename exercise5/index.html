            <p> Overall, I am satisfied with my work in the class in terms of how I have been able to code my websites, but I am not totally satisfied with how they look. For my skill level I think I did quite well, but probably not as well in the grand scheme of web designers and developers. I struggled a lot with placing images throughout the semester, it was one of those things that never really clicked the way other concepts have for me. This class gave me a greater appreciation for web designers and people who code, and also people who wrote the first code that everyone has since stolen. As an ex-comp sci major, I was hesitant to take this class because I had been traumatized by C++, but I am glad that I did because HTML is a million times better. This class has also made me realize how much technical skill goes into creating digital art and that knowing how the programs and code work is an art in itself before you even begin creating your own work. </p>

            <p>I would like to ambitiously code again, especially something like my portfolio, but I am unsure if that will happen unless I find myself with copious amounts of time (which may happen post-grad). I have already used the skills from this class to export HTML code from Mailchimp and host it on Github to create an archive of email newsletters, which was very helpful and secured me extra brownie points at work. Even if I never code from scratch again, this class gave me a better understanding of how to design for the web, which will be beneficial regardless. I do see myself leaning back into my design and visual skills, but I am very grateful I had the opportunity to be re-introduced to coding in this type of class environment!
