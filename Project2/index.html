        <!-- Subsection 1 -->
        <div class="subsection1">
            <p>Handshake's content is optimized for its intended audience – the language is direct and action-oriented. The employment of phrases like "Make career moves" and "Get ahead and get hired" resonates with the ambitious student demographic.</p>
           

            <p>The content effectively employs icons and illustrations to represent different features such as "Inside intel" and "Endless inspiration", using visual metaphors that are easily understandable without relying on text-heavy explanations.</p>

    <!-- Subsection 2: Navigation and Personalization -->
    <div class="subsection4">
        <p>Navigation is intuitive, with a top menu bar clearly differentiating between student, employer, and career center-focused content. Hover and click feedback are well implemented, offering users a tactile sense of interaction.</p>
        <p>The site’s personalization features notably, the job recommendations based on user activity, tailor the experience to individual needs and interests. This personalization extends to the event and employer suggestions, creating a curated experience that can significantly enhance the user's journey through the site.</p>
        <p>The UI employs a card-based layout for categorizing different types of content, which not only aids in organization but also makes the interface more scalable and adaptable to different screen sizes. The integration of company logos in a monochrome format maintains visual harmony and provides a familiar reference point for users, creating an instant connection with well-known brands.</p>

        <!-- Placeholder for Image -->
        <img src="images/jobs2.png" alt="Feature Image 2 for Typography and Layout">
        <p>Typography on the website is strategically used; bold and large sans-serif fonts draw attention to primary actions and information, while secondary texts are appropriately less bold with a clear informational hierarchy. The site’s commitment to maintaining an uncluttered layout with ample white space prevents cognitive overload and facilitates easy content scanning.</p>
